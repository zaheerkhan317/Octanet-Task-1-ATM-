OctaNet Internship - ATM User Interface


🚀 Java ATM System 🏦 - A Hands-On Project 🚀

I've just completed an exciting Java project - a console-based ATM system! 💻

Key Features:

* Secure user authentication with a username and PIN 🔐
* Support for transactions like withdrawals, deposits, and transfers 💵
* Transaction history tracking, so users can review their financial activity 🔎
* A user-friendly interface with input validation for a smooth experience 👍
* I've used object-oriented programming principles to create modular and maintainable code 💡

This Java program simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system. It's designed to provide users with a secure and user-friendly banking experience. Let's dive into how it works:

User Authentication:

Users are prompted to enter their ID and PIN for authentication. Predefined username: "Demo" and password: "123". 🔑

Main Menu:

Upon successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of banking operations. Options include Transaction History, Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer, and Quit. 🏦

Transaction History:

Users can view their transaction history, displaying the type of transaction (Withdraw, Deposit, or Transfer), the transaction amount, and the updated balance. 🧾

Withdrawal:

Users can withdraw funds from their account. The program checks if the withdrawal amount is within the account balance and updates the balance accordingly. 💸

Deposit:

Users can make deposits into their account. The program updates the balance after the deposit is made. 💰

Transfer:

Users can transfer funds to another account. The program validates if the transfer amount is within the account balance and updates the balance accordingly. 💳

Quit:

Users can exit the ATM system. 👋

Transaction History:

The program keeps a record of each transaction with details and displays it upon user request. 📝

Loop for Multiple Transactions:

The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple transactions in a single session. Users can choose to continue or exit the system after each transaction. 🔁

This project not only sharpened my Java skills but also enhanced my understanding of software development. Building a functional ATM system from scratch was both challenging and rewarding. 💪

Feel free to take a look at the code here and explore the inner workings of this project. I'm open to feedback and discussions about how we can improve it further! 🙌
